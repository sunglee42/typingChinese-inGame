# Why?  
Because some games do not support using Chinese in chat rooms.  
I don't know why, maybe it's wrong setting?  
But we can use this "method" to made it work.  

# How to use?  
Step 1:
Download ```Python``` from Microsoft Store (most easy way).  
https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pnrbtzxmb4z  

Step 2:  
Open ```big5_decimal.py``` (if ask, make sure open by Python).  

Step 3:  
Type the Chinese words you want to use (can be multiple words).  
Press ```Enter``` to submit and program will output an array.
likes ```[46809]``` or  ```[42148, 42213]```  
(it will have 5 digits for one word)  

Step 4:  
Press ```Alt``` + ```the code you just converted``` (one word, one times)  
When you release ```Alt```, you can type one Chinese word  

Congratulations 🎉
