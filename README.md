# typingChinese-inGame
Convert text to big5(decimal) to type Chinese in game

# Why?  
Because some games do not support using Chinese in chat rooms.  
I don't know why, maybe it's wrong setting?  
But we can use this "method" to made it work.  

# How to use?  

Press Alt + ```the code you just converted```
